# Create an Account

# Setup Database

follow the provided steps to finish this section.



surely you are going to need a postgres database for your deployment so all you have to do is to create a postgres app first.
in the app section click on the PostgreSQL database.

<div align="center" ><img loading="lazy" style="width:700px" src="../hamravesh-repo-step0-1.png"></div>

then in the next window pick a name for the database service name.

<div align="center" ><img loading="lazy" style="width:700px" src="../hamravesh-repo-step0-2.png"></div>

Note: in our case we dont need to access the database through the internet.

after that just choose a plan for it and create the database instance.
<div align="center" ><img loading="lazy" style="width:700px" src="../hamravesh-repo-step0-3.png"></div>

now that your database is created you can use it for connecting other apps to it.
<div align="center" ><img loading="lazy" style="width:700px" src="../hamravesh-repo-step0-4.png"></div>

the provided database credentials and url are as follows:
``` properties
PGDB_address: APP-NAME.bigdeliali3.svc:5432
PGDB_username: postgres
PGDB_password: ddGrZM7u3BsduXm5ph3WzPYlMWSMTXbu
```
Note: if you dont want to use the default database by the name of postgres,
you just have to head to the terminal tab and create a another database for your project you can call it anything you want.

<div align="center" ><img loading="lazy" style="width:700px" src="../hamravesh-repo-step0-5.png"></div>

```shell
psql -U postgres -c "create database <PGDB_name>"
```
# Setup kong

# Setup grpc Service

## setup general info 

<div align="center" ><img loading="lazy" style="width:700px" src="../python-grpc-repo-2.png"></div>

in this page you have to provide general information's about the app you are about to create, which in my case are as follows:

```
app_name: APP-NAME # name of the app which is going to be called inside the portal
service_port: 50051 # which we declared in the app
execute_command: python main.py
```

<div align="center" ><img loading="lazy" style="width:700px" src="../python-grpc-repo-4.png"></div>

for launching purposes you have to pick a plan for resources. based on the scale and traffic of your project you have to pick one.

and lastly wait till its up and running then you can make requests to it from fastapi service.
